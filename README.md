<h1 align=center>EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS</h1>

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

# 1. Introduction

Prompt Engineering is the art of designing inputs (prompts) that guide an AI model to generate desired outputs. The same AI can produce drastically different responses depending on how a prompt is phrased. This experiment explores whether structured prompts consistently yield better performance than unstructured prompts.

# 2. Defenition of Prompt types

| **Prompt Type**  | **Definition**                                                                           | **Characteristics**                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Naïve Prompt** | A simple, open-ended, or vague input without clear instructions or context.              | Short, lacks detail, no structure, broad query     |
| **Basic Prompt** | A clear, detailed, and structured input that defines task requirements and expectations. | Includes context, tone, structure, and constraints |

# 3. Experimental Procedure
## Step 1:

Design a set of scenarios to test the AI under different conditions.

## Step 2:

For each scenario, create two prompts — one naïve and one basic — targeting the same task.

## Step 3:

Input both prompts into the AI model separately and record the responses.

## Step 4:

Evaluate and compare responses based on:

- Quality (clarity, coherence)

- Accuracy (factual correctness)

- Depth (insight, completeness)

| **3. Concept Summarization**      | “Summarize climate change.”     | “Summarize the concept of climate change in 5 sentences, covering its causes, effects, and global impact.”                                  |
| **4. Advice or Recommendation**   | “Give me advice for studying.”  | “Provide 5 effective study tips for college students preparing for exams. Focus on time management and concentration techniques.”           |
| **5. Professional Communication** | “Write an email to a teacher.”  | “Write a formal email to your professor requesting an extension for your assignment. Keep the tone polite and include subject and closing.” |

# 5. Observed AI Responses

| **Scenario**           | **AI Response (Naïve Prompt)**               | **AI Response (Basic Prompt)**                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creative Story**     | Short, random story lacking plot or emotion. | Structured story with characters, emotion, and moral lesson.          |
| **Factual Question**   | One-line definition.                         | Detailed explanation of Einstein’s life, work, and relativity theory. |
| **Summarization**      | Generic and incomplete summary.              | Concise summary addressing all required aspects.                      |
| **Advice**             | General, repetitive tips.                    | Practical, organized list with clear focus on time and concentration. |
| **Professional Email** | Informal and incomplete message.             | Polite, formatted email with subject, greeting, and closing.          |

# 6. Evaluation Table

| **Criteria** | **Naïve Prompt**          | **Basic Prompt**                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Quality**  | Basic, sometimes unclear. | High — coherent, polished, well-structured. |
| **Accuracy** | Partial or general.       | Detailed and factually correct.             |
| **Depth**    | Surface-level.            | Context-rich and thoughtful.                |

# 7. Analysis

- **Quality:** The AI responded more coherently to basic prompts due to better context and constraints.

- **Accuracy:** Clear prompts reduced ambiguity, leading to more factual and relevant answers.

- **Depth:** Basic prompts encouraged elaboration and logical explanation.

- **Observation:**

	- In creative and factual tasks, structure and tone guidance made responses more human-like.

	- Naïve prompts performed moderately in simple or open-ended tasks but lacked direction.

# 8. Findings

**1.**    Prompt clarity directly impacts AI output quality. 

**2.**    Structured prompts yield more reliable and informative responses.  

**3.**    Naïve prompts may still work for casual or brainstorming purposes.  

**4.**    For academic or professional use, refined prompts are essential.  

# 9. Conclusion

The experiment confirms that basic prompts significantly improve AI performance in terms of quality, accuracy, and depth.
Clear structure, defined expectations, and contextual cues help the AI generate more meaningful, accurate, and useful responses.
Naïve prompts can be effective for creative exploration but not for precise or analytical tasks.
